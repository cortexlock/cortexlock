## I'm James.

I'm a software developer and live in Windsor, just outside London. I love JavaScript (even with its odd parts) and the ecosystem, especially React and Node.

I'm currently looking sideways at Svelte and hoping React doesn't notice, and very keen to develop more in Python and try Rust. With that said, I'd be happy to use anything - it's all about the right tool for the job.

For me, the mission is everything. If I'm into an idea, I'm unstoppable. When I'm not coding, I love cycling, playing modern boardgames and spending quality time with my family under big skies.

Fun fact: In my past life as a doctor, I administered anaesthesia to thousands of patients. We still don't fully understand how the drugs work on the brain.
