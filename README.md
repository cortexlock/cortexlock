## I'm James.

I'm a doctor turned software developer living in Windsor, just outside London. I love JavaScript (even with its odd parts) and the ecosystem, especially React - though these days I'd rather not leave home without Typescript. Back end wise I mainly use Node / Express. I'm a newly hatched Rustacean and enjoying the journey, I also work with PostgreSQL, Firebase and a bit of GCP.

With that said, I'd be happy to learn and use anything - it's all about the right tool for the job. I'm really passionate about a quality end product and user experience - this has to come about as a result of great communication between stakeholders and dev teams.

When I'm not coding, I teach U10 rugby and love football, surfing, cycling, and spending quality time with my family under big skies.
