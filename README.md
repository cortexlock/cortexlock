## I'm James.

I'm a doctor turned software developer living in Windsor, just outside London. I love JavaScript (even with its odd parts) and the ecosystem, especially React - though these days I'd rather not leave home without Typescript. I'm a newly hatched Rustacean, and I'm currently looking sideways at Svelte and hoping React doesn't notice. With that said, I'd be happy to use anything - it's all about the right tool for the job.

For me, the mission is everything - if I'm into an idea, I'm like the Duracell bunny. When I'm not coding, I teach U10 rugby and love surfing, cycling, playing modern boardgames and spending quality time with my family under big skies.
